# Roadmap

This project is in a pre-alpha version, so this roadmap is just a list of points, which would be nice â€“ don't treat it as written in stone points.
There are no explicit priorities here, and some items can be thrown away, and some can be added later.

- add description data-attribute
- add querying against preview option
- add possibility to style:
  - border/overlay for elements with data-attributes
  - specific styles for content-types
- improve tooltip:
  - add "nose", so it looks better
  - automatically detect at which side it is better to render tooltip
- list of CTs/entries/assets:
  - fold
- add locale support

- add field link to the popup

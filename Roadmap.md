# Roadmap

This project is in a pre-alpha version, so this roadmap is just a list of points, which would be nice â€“ don't treat it as written in stone points.
There are no explicit priorities here, and some items can be thrown away, and some can be added later.

- ~~add description data-attribute~~
- ~~add querying against preview option~~
- ~~add assets rendering~~
- add possibility to style:
  - ~~border/overlay for elements with data-attributes~~
  - specific styles for content-types
- improve tooltip:
  - add "nose", so it looks better
  - automatic rearrangement according to the screen's position
  - automatically detect at which side it is better to render tooltip
- list of CTs/entries/assets:
  - fold more than 5 elements
- add locale support

- add field link to the popup
